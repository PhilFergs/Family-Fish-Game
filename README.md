# Family-Fish-Game

Family-Fish-Game is a small, lighthearted fish game where you swim, grow, and dodge
threats in a colorful tank.

Built with Godot, with help from Codex. The original idea came from my kids,
and they kept asking for new features to add.

You only need to download the .exe and .pck files and have them in the same folder to play. 
or you can download the .zip and extract.
